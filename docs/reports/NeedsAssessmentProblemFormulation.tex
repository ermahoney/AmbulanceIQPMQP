  \section{Outline}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{Introduction}
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item \textbf{Introduce your products} - The technological sphere has recently undergone a shift from specialization to interdisciplinarity; the renaissance of the 21st century. As a result, different technologies are becoming more integrated and interconnected which builds on the networking concept of the internet of things (IoT). Different sensors and devices are working as one to gather or process data, communicate information, and create knowledge. Though, due to vast size of IoT and technological boundaries, there are many challanges that must be confronted in order to make the system efficient, secure, and effective. Those challenges include energy usage, scalability, security, communicability, and heterogeneous iterconnectivity \cite{kranengurg}. The quantity side of communicability is well researched but the quality side is neglected. Large amounts of data are being gathered and processed into information but that information must be appropriately visually or verbally communicated in order for the system to be effective. This is particularly true of medical IoT where the goal is to improve the mental and physical capacity of overburdened medical staff. The goal of ARMES is to collect, organize, and transmit patient vitals and information for emergency medical services (EMS) and hospitals. ARMES is setup to collect patient vitals and route data through a drone out to EMS or the inbound hospital. Additionally, ARMES is setup to identify the location of the patient and find the quickest/safest route for EMS to get to the patient and back to the closest/most relevant hospital. If EMS cannot immediately extract the patient, ARMES can also use location data to send a drone to drop medical supplies and well as provide verbal or visual medical support through routing communications from EMS to the patient. Hospital personnel recieve the information via a secure computer or smartphone app that visually triages and tags the patients based on their vitals and EMS input as well as idenitfies the location and status of patients in an interactive map view. The triage list and status map give hospital perssonel and EMS information on patients as a whole. Alternatively, individual patient data can be further explored by simply tapping on a patient within the triage list or interactive map.
          \newpage

          \item \textbf{Explain why you expect your product to have market appeal} - Triage is already used by EMS and emergency rooms to manually sort patients based on the severity of their injuries. ARMES will automate the sorting process for EMS in mass casualty events and for triage nurses in emergency rooms and provide additional functionality to further improve medical staff's situational awareness over their patients. Ultimately, ARMES will improve the mental and physical capacity of medical staff which in turn improves their efficiency and effectiveness which is inline with the military's goals.
        \end{enumerate}

      \item \textbf{Market Research}
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item \textbf{Identify your market(s) and explain how you conducted market research} - In its early phase, ARMES will be built for military medical services. Later on, the system may be built for public and private emergency medical services. Market reserach was centered around the U.S. Army grant as well as current technologies being used by the military. Public competitors were also identified for the sake of understanding the pros and cons of avalible technology.

          \item \textbf{Describe the results your research yielded} - Research yielded public competitors are hospital or home oriented (static) and do not have any avalible technologies that explore the EMS domain nor explore the seamless integration of EMS and hospital data. Private competators/partners do explore the EMS domain and focus on automated documentation and patient data exchange between EMS and hospitals but do not cover the full spectrum of funtionality that ARMES proposes.

          \item \textbf{Describe the conclusions you have drawn from the research} - ARMES fits a unique sector in the medical field that has not yet been actively explored by either civilian and military researchers.
        \end{enumerate}

            \begin{enumerate}
              \item Security - infliences how communications are secured and how patient data is stored
